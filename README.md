# RoboTravel
The program uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to calculate the shortest path the robot can take through a matrix-drawn camera. 
The matrix has in the file Trajectory.txt several predefined routes that the robot can travel, it chooses to travel the shortest, 
a visual effect is added in the terminal to see how it moves.
